# Timed Quiz

## Description

The assignment was to create a timed quiz using html css and JavaScript. Once the quiz was done the page would present the user with a quiz score and an location to save ther intitial to the page along with there highscore (how many questions they got right on the quiz). The motivation for this project was to practice for real world web development scenarios where one is tasked with building projects such as this one. What I learned from this project was how to set time intervals using JavaScript, becoming more familiar with functions and for loops, gaing a better knowledge of "document.querySelector", and finally utilizing the "addEventListener.

## Installation

The step for installing this project were creating a git remote repository and then a local repository. After linking both repositories I created an html, JS and CSS, and README file. I then started with the HTMl file, creating sections, classes, IDs that would display and function with the CSS and JS files. I then started to style the html with CSS to get the colors and settings I wanted. The majority of this project revolved around the JavaScript. I started with creating the variables in the global scope to use for all the functions. After I worked on the time interval for the timed quiz; giving the user 15 seconds to answer all the questions. Then I moved on to setting attributes to sections of the application so that not all the sections were displayed at once; I hid the quiz question and answer section so that the user started at the introduction section with a start quiz button. The next section was the quiz itself, I set a function to have the array of questions and answers display one at a time so that not all the Q&A's were displayed together. I then functions that save the initials of the user after the quiz. It was meant to save the users highscore as well. The project is still a work in progress and I was having trouble saving the quiz score with the user's initials.

## Usage

This project is a quiz game application that test the user in a timed manner and record there initials and quiz score.
